The following scripts are part of the 'buildfink' system:

*analyze
	Assigns the outcome of each package's build to a category,
	as determined by filters.xml and the filter script.
*buildfink
	The core script; performs the actual build.
*buildstats
	See how long each package took to build and how large its log was.
*cleanfink
	Purge all non-essential packages
*cmplink
	HTML-ify the output from cmpruns.
*cmpruns
	Compare two runs and get a list of packages which are unique to
	each run and packages which which transitioned either to or away
	from failure.
*filter
	A tool used by 'analyze' to sort the logs.  It tests files against
	a series of regular expressions and sorts them into lists depending
	on which regex they match.
*finkfilter_sysgcc
	An info file filter, to be used in conjunction with
	"buildfink --infofilter", which causes /usr/bin/gcc to be
	used to compile the package, removing any attempts by the
	package to build with an alternate compiler, such as /usr/bin/gcc-3.3
*maintnotify
	Notify maintainers about problems with their packages.
*owbuild
	Script msachs uses to kick off his buildfink runs.  Included
	as documentation and an example.
*report
	Running this script from the 'out' subdirectory of a run after running
	'analyze' will produce the HTML and text reports.
