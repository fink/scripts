NOTE: as of 25 October 2011, the buildpkg.sh script is not likely to work with
versions of OS X prior to 10.5 (maybe even 10.7).  If necessary, older versions
of buildpkg.sh can be obtained from the old read-only CVS repository.

Setup environment variables: 
 BINDIST_VERSION is the version of fink you want to install, as a numerical
 triplet value such as 0.4.5

 ARCH is the architecture being used (PowerPC, Intel, or x86_64)

 OSX_VERSION is the (minimum) OS X version for this installation

 IN_BASEDIR is the directory containing this script (full pathname, with
 no trailing slash).  You are going to need /sw to be clear for this 
 installation, so if you move /sw to another location such as /sw.orig, 
 be sure to reset IN_BASEDIR to the correct value. IN_BASEDIR should
 not contain any spaces, quotes, or metachars.

 FINK_ROOT is the path for the Fink install location.  This will almost
 always be /sw, but can be set to another value, which is useful really
 only for testing.
 If FINK_ROOT is not set, then it defaults to /sw.

TODO: figure out how to patch destined $target_OSX and $target_CPU
into InstallationCheck and *.lproj/InstallationCheck.strings

Step 1:
 Clear out /sw so that a fresh version can be installed there.

Step 2:
 Download fink-BINDIST_VERSION-full.tar.gz from sourceforge (or use the copy
 you generated when building the srcdist), unpack it and run "./bootstrap",
 installing into /sw.  Accept all default choices during configuration.

Step 2A:
 Make sure that the file CURRENT-FINK-$OSX_VERSION is present on the fink
 website, and run "/sw/bin/fink selfupdate", selecting option 3 (stick to
 point releases).

Step 3:
 Run "/sw/bin/fink update-all" in case there were updates to base-packages 
 since the last package manager release.

Step 4:
 Remove all .deb's in /sw/fink/dists/stable/main/binary-darwin-x86_64/* , 
 and then remove all symlinks from /sw/fink/debs - you can do this by doing:
 "sudo find /sw/fink -name '*.deb' -exec rm -rf {} \;"

Step 5:
 Remove /sw/src/*

Step 6:
 Run "/sw/bin/fink scanpackages", and then "sudo /sw/bin/apt-get update" to 
 properly prepare for distribution. 

Step6a:
 Run "/sw/bin/fink list --installed" to be ready with the information when 
 needed in step 8.

Step 6b:
 Check permissions in your /sw directory to verify things are world-readable 
 when appropriate

Step 6c:
 Run "chmod 1755 IN_BASEDIR/contents" to get the permissions of the 
 "contents" directory to match those of / on the target machine.

Step 7:
 Move the entire /sw directory into a subdirectory of IN_BASEDIR/contents 
 (that is, you should have a directory IN_BASEDIR/contents/sw/ when you are 
 finished).
 Run "sudo cp -Rp /sw $IN_BASEDIR/contents" to copy.  This preserves internal
 file permissions.

Step 7a:
 Update the copy of FinkCommander in IN_BASEDIR/dmg to the latest version.

Step 8.
 Use TextEdit to examine the files in the resources and dmg subdirs of 
 IN_BASEDIR, editing if necessary. You will need to edit the list of 
 installed packages which appears at the end of resources/ReadMe.rtf. 
 Leave the OSX_VERSION, BINDIST_VERSION, ARCH, and IN_VERSION variables as-is;
 these will be replaced by the script. (IN_VERSION is replaced by 
 BINDIST_VERSION-ARCH.)

 Be sure to clean out any *~ files or other stray files generated during 
 editing.

Step 9.
 Run "sudo ./buildpkg.sh" (use "sudo -E" on 10.6+) This should copy the 
 resources and dmg directories, subsituting versions in the various read 
 me files. It will then create the pkg file in the dmg-BINDIST_VERSION-ARCH 
 directory. Then, a .dmg will be created and end up in the IN_BASEDIR. The 
 Volume name should be "Fink BINDIST_VERSION-ARCH Installer". 
 
Step 10.
 Mount and test the .dmg. Send it to someone else to test before release 
 as well.

Step 11.
 Commit your revised versions of the .rtf and other files to CVS for the 
 benefit of future releases. Tag the CVS with a release tag of the form
 release_x_y_z .

That's it, you're done!
