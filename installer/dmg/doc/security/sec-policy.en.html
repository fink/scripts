<h1 style="text-align: center;">General Fink security policy for accepted packages.</h1>
        <p>This document explains security incident handling for packages that
            have been accepted by Fink. While the main responsibility for every
            accepted package in Fink remains with the respective maintainer,
            Fink recognizes the necessity to offer a uniform policy on how to
            react to security incidents found in software which are offered as
            Fink packages. Every package maintainer is required to comply with it.</p>

        <h3><a name="respo.who">1.1 Who is responsible?</a></h3>
            
            <p>Every Fink package has a Maintainer. The maintainer of a
                particular package can be found by typing <tt style="white-space: nowrap;">fink info
                packagename</tt> at the command line prompt. This will return
                a listing with a field similar to this one: Maintainer: Fink
                    Core Group
                &lt;fink-core@lists.sourceforge.net&gt;. The
                maintainer has full responsibility for his/her package(s).</p>
        
        <h3><a name="respo.contact">1.2 Whom shall I contact?</a></h3>
            
            <p>If there are security incidents within a certain piece of
                packaged software, you should notify the maintainer of that
                package as well as the <b>Fink Core Team</b>. The email of the
                maintainer can be found within the packages info, and the email
                of the <b>Fink Core Team</b> is
                fink-core@lists.sourceforge.net </p>
        
        <h3><a name="respo.prenotifications">1.3 Pre-notifications</a></h3>
            
            <p>Serious security incidents in software packaged by Fink might
                require you to pre-notify the maintainer of that package. Since
                it is possible that the maintainer cannot be reached in a timely
                manner, pre-notifications should always also be submitted to the
                    <b>Fink Security Team</b>. Each team members e-mail is
                listed individually later on in this document. Please note that
                fink-core@lists.sourceforge.net is a publically archived mailing
                list, private pre-notifications should <b>never</b> be sent to
                that list.</p>
        
        <h3><a name="respo.response">1.4 Response</a></h3>
            
            <p>Submitted reports about a security incident will be answered by
                the <b>Fink Core Team</b>. Each maintainer is required by Fink
                to acknowledge the reported issue individually. In the unlikely
                event that the maintainer is not available and the maintainer
                has not acknowledged the report within 24 hours, a note should
                be sent to the <b>Fink Core Team</b> informing the team that
                the maintainer might be unresponsive. </p>
            <p>In the event that you attempted to notify the maintainer of the
                package in question but the mail system returned a delivery
                error for that email you should notify the <b>Fink Core
                Team</b> immediately to inform them that the maintainer is
                unreachable and that the package may be updated irrespective of
                the maintainer. </p>
        
    <h2><a name="severity">2 Response times and immediate actions.</a></h2>
        
        
        
            <p>Response time and actions taken greatly depend on the severity of
                the loss introduced by a particular flaw in the software that
                has been packaged for Fink. In any case the <b>Fink Core
                Team</b> will take immediate action whenever it feels it is
                necessary to protect the Fink user community.</p>
        
        <h3><a name="severity.resptimes">2.1 Response times</a></h3>
            
            <p>Each package should strive to meet the following response times.
                For some types of vulnerabilities the <b>Fink Core Team</b>
                might choose to take immediate action. If that is the case, one
                of the Core Team members will notify the maintainer of the
                package in question. Also, keep in mind that, while we strive to
                meet these response times, Fink is a volunteer effort, and they
                cannot be guaranteed.</p>

        <h3><a name="severity.forced">2.2 Forced updates</a></h3>
            
            <p>A member of the <b>Fink Core Team</b> might choose to update a
                package without waiting for the package's maintainer to take
                action. This is called a forced update. Not
                meeting the maximum required response time for a particular
                vulnerability in a Fink package also results in a forced
                update of that package.</p>

        <h3><a name="sources.sources">3.1 Acceptable Incident Sources.</a></h3>
            
            <p>As submitter of a security incident in Fink-packaged software you
                have to ensure that the vulnerability of the software also
                exists on Mac OS X. It is the responsibility of the notifying party
                to ensure that one of the following sources reinforces the
                reported issue for the particular software in question.</p>
